## Project Overview
This project implements a simple classification task on the Iris dataset, one of the most renowned datasets in data science.

### Motivation
The goal is to become an "iris expert" using a dataset of 150 iris instances with petal/sepal measurements, and to determine which measurements are the most useful features.

### Procedures
1. Import Libraries and Load Dataset
2. Numerical Summary
3. Train-Test Split
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Model Development
6. Further Discussion

### Models Implemented
- Classification Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (linear and polynomial kernels)

## Installation
To install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Demo
A simple web demo is available [here](https://dehao-iris-clf.herokuapp.com/). It displays model prediction results based on user-input parameters.
